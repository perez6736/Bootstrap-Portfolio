						My name is Daniel Perez. I am 27 years old. I first got into computers as a little kid through video games. I remember my parents got my first computer when I was about 5 years old. The windows 95 start screen is still an image in my mind I can see very clearly. I remember watching my brother installing the games and that alone amazed my 5 year old mind. The game was command and conquer, an real time strategy (RTS) game one of the first of its kind. I was immieditly hooked. I played other games as well such as sim city 2000, sim tower and some of the preloaded window games too. Chip's adventure was one of the best games that came with windows.

						After a while the internet became the thing to have. Connecting to the internet included screeching sounds of AOL and yelling at my parents to get off the phone. I was surfing the web going to sites and reading about everyhting, watching every flash video and playing all the flash games. At this point I found a way to get my hands on adobe macromedia flash and I was starting to make my own animations and games. They were very bad and realized just how hard it was to code the objects in the animation so it will move with the arrow keys. That was my first taste of coding. I just stuck with making simple animations because I was still not even in High School at this point.

						My brother had just started college and was just starting junior high school. My brother decided to build a custom computer for school. I remember watching and asking so many questions about what is what and why he was connecting pieces the way he was. That thing was a beast. The times he was home from school he would bring his computer and modified xbox. The xbox itself had thounsands of games, tv shows and movies. Which at the time was amzing for me. But the fact that he built the computer and hacked the xbox himself with his college buddies was the more amzing part. His friends at college seemed like geniuses building computers and modifing xboxs and turning them into the ultmate media center. During all that exposure to technology I knew Id probably end up the same way.
